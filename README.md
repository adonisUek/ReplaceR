# ReplaceR
ReplaceR is user-friendly and responsive application used to release or switch appointments for example in fitness clubs, private schools etc. between app users. We can gather in one app data of our different appointments to be more organized, or release our appointments when we can't participate for other who has access to this activities (e.g. is also enrolled in these classes).
